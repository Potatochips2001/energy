### Calculating energy from explosions
To calculate energy from explosions, you multiply the volume by the density of the explosive, multiply by the explosive energy density. <br/>
example: A pipe of 5 cm tall and 4 cm in diameter has a volume of 62.8cm^3, multiply that by an explosive density like TNT for example to get the grams 1.65g/cm^3. Now multiply by the energy density of the explosive (TNT) which is 4,184 Joules per gram. <br/>
The result is 433,546 Joules. If there are 6894.7573 newtons in 1 psi we can calculate that to 62.88 PSI. <br/>
You can use the <a href="https://potatochips2001.github.io/sound/" target="_blank">sound calculator</a> to calculate the decibels.
### list of explosives
TNT = 4184 Joules/gram & density = 1.65 g/cm^3 <br/>
RDX = 6000 Joules/gram & density = 1.82 g/cm^3 <br/>
Composition B (60/40 RDX/TNT) = 5200 Joules/gram & density = 1.65 g/cm^3 <br/>
Flash powder = 9200 Joules/gram & density = 0.8 g/cm^3 <br/>
Black powder = 3000 Joules/gram & density = 1.8 g/cm^3 <br/>
Uranium-235 (15 kg in a nuke) = 144,000,000 MJ/kg & density = 19.1 g/cm^3 <br/>
Hydrogen = 120 MJ/kg & density = 0.0701 g/cm^3 <br/>
Smokeless powder = 6,375 J/g & density = 1.6 G/cm^2 <br.>
Gasoline = 46 MJ/kg & density = 755 kg/m^3
### explosive damages to human body
2 PSI can possibly rupture ear drums <br/>
5 PSI ruptures ear drums (50%)<br/>
7.5 to 15 can lead to brain damage<br/>
14 PSI ruptures ear drums (100%) & possibly ruptures lungs<br/>
40 PSI ruptures lungs (50%) & can cause death <br/>
80 PSI ruptures intestines & ruptures 100% of lungs<br/>
100 PSI results in death almost always

Hydrostatic shock `Hydrostatic shock is the controversial concept that a penetrating projectile (such as a bullet) can produce a pressure wave that causes "remote neural damage", "subtle damage in neural tissues" and/or "rapid incapacitating effects" in living targets.` - From wikipedia <br/>
`an analysis of experiments of dogs shot in the thigh they report highly significant (p < 0.01), easily detectable neural effects in the hypothalamus and hippocampus with energy transfer levels close to 550 ft⋅lbf (750 J). - From wikipedia` <br/>
Energy transfered from bullet to human body can result in brain damage and ruptured organs. The human skin density 1.02 g/cm2 which is 10.2 kg/m2 <br/>
If a 9mm transfers 490 Joules of kinetic energy, the human body it will have a hydrostatic shock of 48 Joules because of the skin having a density of 10.2 kg/m2. It takes about 50 Joules to cause brain damage and 80 Joules for 50% chance of brain damage. <br/>
Explosives If an explosive goes off it releases a lot of energy depending on the energy density of the chemicals used, flash powder for example has an energy density of 9,200 J/g, dividing ~6,900 from Joules and you would get the PSI, 40 PSI has a 50% chance of rupturing lungs.
Decibels are on a log scale, so 10dB is 10x less energy, 20x 100x less energy, etc. Being behind a wall would reduce 30dB(own data from decibel readers), therefor an explosion energy can be divided by 1,000 <br/>
Larger walls can reduce decibels by about 40 at times. 40PSI/1,000 = 0.04 PSI, which makes a huge difference to being next to an explosion.

### Force time
A lot of people don't know this one so here <br/>
F = m * v / time
